# Fintrack Microservices

> 🚀 A modernized, cloud-native personal finance tracking system inspired by [PiggyMetrics](https://github.com/sqshq/piggymetrics), redesigned with a production-grade architecture, observability, and container-first approach.

## ✨ What's Different from the Original?

- Spring Boot 3.x and Jakarta EE migration
- Docker and Kubernetes-ready microservices
- Replaced legacy Hystrix with Resilience4j
- Observability via OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana
- Modular build, CI/CD ready (GitHub Actions)
- Cloud-agnostic and lightweight container images
